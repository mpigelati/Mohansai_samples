#(a) More than one entry per key not allowed. Which means no duplicate key is allowed. When duplicate keys encountered during assignment, the last assignment wins. For example âˆ’

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Name': 'Manni'}

print ("dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'])

#   (b)Keys must be immutable. Which means you can use strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary keys but something like ['key'] is not allowed. Following is a simple example:

dict = {['Name']: 'Zara', 'Age': 7}

print ("dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'])
